  # Sets a very high safety limit to handle extreme, unexpected traffic spikes 
  # (e.g., viral traffic or a DDoS) without returning a 429 error.
  # This acts as a protective ceiling, not a baseline you will pay for.

  # Maximum number of concurrent requests an instance will handle.

  # Dedicated CPU is highly recommended for dynamic/SSR applications 
  # to improve performance under concurrency and ensure predictable scaling.

  # Allocating more memory provides a safety buffer, especially when handling 
  # many concurrent requests or running a memory-intensive framework (like Next.js).
